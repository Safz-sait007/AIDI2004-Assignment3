# AIDI2004-Assignment3

##Introduction
   
In modern web applications, managing data efficiently is crucial for functionality and user experience. This project implements a Flask-based CRUD API that allows for the creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion of student records stored in an SQLite database. The API is designed for seamless interaction using tools like Postman and integrates SQLAlchemy for database operations.

## Objective
The goal of this project is to create a RESTful API using Flask to manage student records. The API should be able to:
•	Create a new student entry.
•	Retrieve all student records or a specific student by ID.
•	Update an existing student record.
•	Delete a student record.

##Technology Stack
The following technologies and tools were used to develop the API:
•	Backend: Flask (Python), Flask-SQLAlchemy
•	Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
•	Database: SQLite
•	Tools: Postman (for API testing), VS Code (for development)
